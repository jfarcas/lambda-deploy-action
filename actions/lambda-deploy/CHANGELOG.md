## [lambda-deploy-v1.1.1] - 2025-08-23

### üîß Bug Fixes
- **Fixed version detection failure in production environment**: Corrected S3 path structure mismatch between version conflict checking and actual deployment paths
- **Fixed artifact path configuration**: Moved artifact configuration from `quality_checks.artifact.path` to `build.artifact.path` to match action expectations
- **Fixed Teams notification environment**: Reverted Teams notification trigger from `prod` to `dev` environment for backward compatibility with v1.0.0

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements
- **S3 Structure Consistency**: Aligned all scripts to use the simplified S3 structure (`lambda_function/environment/version.zip`) instead of the complex nested structure
- **Version Conflict Detection**: Enhanced version conflict checking to properly handle new production environments with no previous deployments
- **Rollback Path Consistency**: Fixed rollback artifact retrieval to use correct S3 paths across all scripts

### üìù Files Updated
- `scripts/version-conflicts.sh`: Fixed S3 path structure and added object-specific checking
- `scripts/version-history.sh`: Updated to use correct S3 structure for version listing
- `scripts/rollback-retriever.sh`: Aligned S3 key generation with deployer structure
- `scripts/auto-rollback.sh`: Fixed rollback artifact path resolution
- `action.yml`: Reverted Teams notification environment trigger
- Consumer config example: Fixed artifact path configuration location

### üéØ Impact
- **Production deployments**: Now work correctly even when no previous deployments exist
- **Version conflicts**: Properly detected using actual S3 object existence rather than directory structure
- **Rollbacks**: Function correctly with consistent S3 path resolution
- **Teams notifications**: Restored to original v1.0.0 behavior for dev environment
